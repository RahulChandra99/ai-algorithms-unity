# AI Algorithms in Unity  

## Aim of Project
To various AI techniques for NPC behavior, pathfinding, decision-making, and combat AI.

Inspired by AI mechanics from:  
- **Halo, F.E.A.R., The Last of Us** – Smart enemy AI and decision-making  
- **XCOM, Total War** – Tactical AI and pathfinding  
- **Racing Games (Forza, NFS)** – AI-driven vehicle movement

## TODO 
###  AI Navigation & Pathfinding  
- [ ] **A* Pathfinding** – Efficient path calculation for NPC movement  
- [ ] **NavMesh Navigation** – Dynamic pathfinding using Unity’s NavMesh  
- [ ] **Steering Behaviors** – Seek, flee, wander, and pursue  
- [ ] **Crowd Simulation** – AI movement in groups with avoidance  

### Decision-Making AI  
- [ ] **Finite State Machine (FSM)** – AI state transitions (Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack)  
- [ ] **Behavior Trees** – Complex AI behaviors with hierarchical decision-making  
- [ ] **Utility-Based AI** – AI selects the best action based on scores  
- [ ] **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)** – AI plans multiple steps ahead  

### Combat AI  
- [ ] **Enemy Detection & Awareness** – Sight, sound, and stealth mechanics  
- [ ] **Cover & Shooting AI** – AI hides, peeks, and shoots from cover  
- [ ] **Squad AI** – AI coordinates in groups (flanking, assisting allies)  
- [ ] **Ranged vs. Melee AI** – AI adapts combat based on weapon type  

### Vehicle & Racing AI  
- [ ] **Waypoint Navigation** – AI follows race tracks dynamically  
- [ ] **Obstacle Avoidance** – AI adjusts speed and direction in real-time  
- [ ] **Overtaking Logic** – AI calculates the best time to pass opponents  

### General AI Features  
- [ ] **AI Perception System** – Vision cones, noise detection, and reaction times  
- [ ] **AI Debugging Tools** – Visualize paths, decisions, and states in real-time  
- [ ] **Optimization** – AI performance tuning for large-scale NPCs  


 **Work in Progress!**
